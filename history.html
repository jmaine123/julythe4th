    <h1>America's Fun Facts</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>The Statue of Liberty is associated with New York City, but it is actually physically located in New Jersey! Jersey City, New Jersey to be exact. Another fun fact: The seven rays on the crown of the Statue of Liberty represent the seven continents; each measures up to 9 feet in length and weighs as much as 150 pounds.</li>
      <li>The tallest mountain in the world is actually located in the United States. It is actually taller than Mount Everest (more than twice Mt. Everest’s base-to-peak height) when measured from the seafloor. It’s called Mauna Kea and it’s located in Hawaii. While it is only 13,796 feet in altitude above sea level, when measured from the seafloor it is over 32,000 feet high, while Mount Everest is 29,028 feet high.</li>
      <li>The Liberty Bell was last rung on George Washington’s Birthday in 1846. It received its fatal crack a few hours later. Look closely and you will see that the word “Pennsylvania” is mispelled as “Pensylvania.” They must not have had spell check back in those days! The bell is said to have been built for $225.50 USD and it was rung on July 8, 1776 for the first public reading of The Declaration of Independence. Today it is officially owned by the city of Philadelphia, while the National Park Service maintains it’s state-of-the-art facilities, where it has been housed since 2003, nearby Independence Hall and visiting is free of charge. I suppose it didn’t take too long to recoup their $225.50 investment!</li>
      <li>Americans eat about 100 acres of pizza each day, with about 3 billion pizzas sold annually in the USA. 93% of Americans are said to have eaten pizza in the last month. Delivery sales of pizza spike the most during close Super Bowl games. There are over 60,000 pizzerias in the USA and America’s oldest pizzeria opened in 1905 and it’s called Lambardi’s and it is located in NYC (though there is a little controversy over that title). Chicago-style deep dish favorites are Giordano’s or Lou Malnati’s. There is a Pizza Expo held every year in Las Vegas. The world’s largest pizza was actually built in Italy. With October being the US national pizza month, I figured it was a perfect time to share all of these amazing pizza facts with you.</li>
